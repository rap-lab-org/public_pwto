### Installation

* Download and compile [EMOA*](https://github.com/wonderren/public_emoa) by following the instructions there. The downloading directory is suggested to be "../public_emoa" with respect to the directory of this readme file. Otherwise, context.py may need to be changed to get this package running (not tested).

* Install [cyipopt](https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html#) by following the section "On Ubuntu 18.04 Using APT Dependencies".

* Install [opty](https://opty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by `pip3 install opty`

* Run pip3 install for any missing packages, e.g. sympy.
